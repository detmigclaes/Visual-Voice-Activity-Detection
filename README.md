# Visual-Voice-Activity-Detection V-VAD
Project for Computer Vision F23

This project will explore methods for Voice Activity Detection.
This will include a review of methods in the following papers:

\begin{itemize} 
\item Audio-video fusion strategies for active speaker
detection in meetings by Lionel Pibre, Francisco Madrigal, Cyrille Equoy, Fredéric Leraslé, Thomas Pellegrini, Julien Pinquier, Isabelle Ferrané \cite{AV_fusion}

\item RespVAD: Voice Activity Detection via Video-Extracted Respiration Patterns by Arnab Mondal and Prathosh A.P \cite{RespVAD}

\item Vision-based Active Speaker Detection in Multiparty Interactions by Kalin Stefanov, Jonas Beskow, Giampiero Salvi \cite{VVAD_mutli}

\item S-VVAD: Visual Voice Activity Detection by Motion Segmentation by Muhammad Shahid, Cigdem Beyan, Vittorio Murino \cite{S_VVAD}

\item RealVAD: A Real-World Dataset and A Method for
Voice Activity Detection by Body Motion Analysis by Cigdem Beyan, Muhammad Shahid, Vittorio Murino \cite{RealVAD}
